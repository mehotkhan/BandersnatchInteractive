00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120
-潘达什么？ -潘达斯奈基
- Your Bander-what? - Bandersnatch.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
我是根据一本书改编的
I've based it on the book.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.280
（《潘达斯奈基》 杰罗姆·F·戴维斯著）

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.600

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.360
对 在她的东西里面
It was in her things, yeah.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.400
-不知道她读没读过 -应该没有
- Don't know if she read it though. - Don't think so.

Well, he can't be a great writer.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.280
你一直都在跳来跳去地看
You're always flicking backwards and forwards in that.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.120
不是的 这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
No, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
你来决定你的角色怎么做
You decide what your character does.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.080
像游戏一样
- You know, like a game. - Sounds thrilling.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.120

That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.040
去打个招呼吧
Let's say hello.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.840

- Sure he won't mind? He's working. - He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

The state of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.120
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.840
外面卖的卷烟都有士的宁 闹笑话的人是他
Well, pre-rolled has strychnine in them, so the joke's on him.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.000
随便了 这位是斯蒂芬…
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

除了康懋达电脑上的那些 我没有康懋达电脑
Except the Commodore ones, I don't... don't have a Commodore.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.280
-康懋达电脑声卡不错 -是啊
- Great sound chip, the Commodore. - Mm-hm.

It's called Nohzdyve.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.360
-游戏界面真流畅 -花了一些功夫
- The sprites are so smooth. - That took some doing.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.440
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.280
-怎么了？ -缓冲区错误
- What's that? - It's a buffer error.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.920
显存超了
The eyeballs have overrun the video memory...

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.280
是啊 显存 我正要说呢
Oh, yeah, video memory, yeah.

75
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.160
I was going to say that.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.240
这样 说正经事吧
Anyway, listen, let's get down to business.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.720
斯蒂芬要给我们演示点东西
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.440
厉害了
Bloody hell.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160
就像三维怪物迷宫？
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.040
不过人是在不断进行选择
Only when you're moving from choice to choice.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.240
-其实是一个探险游戏 -像《霍比特人》
- It's actually an adventure game. - Like<i> The Hobbit?</i>

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.320
嗯 但不用打字
Yeah, but...
without any typing.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.240
不用打字？
Without any typing?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.600
-所以不会有“找灯”什么的？ -对
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

86
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.600
That's right.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.080
屏幕上出现选择 倒计时内确定就行
Choices come up on the screen and you pick one against the clock.

OK, he's Pax, he's the demon. He's in the book.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.440
我们其实到了一个选择点
So we've actually arrived at a choice point,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.360
用游戏杆进行选择
and then you can choose with the joystick.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.960
有十秒时间
You've got ten seconds.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.600
崇拜他
Worship him.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.040
不要这样 他是命运的窃贼…
No, don't do that, he's the Thief of Destiny...

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.320
我是说 在书里
in the book, I mean.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.920
我家里有一本 但从没读过
Got a copy of this at home. Never got around to reading it.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.840
你应该读读 杰罗姆·戴维斯是天才
You should. Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.560
他不是发疯了 砍下了妻子的头吗？
Didn't he go bonkers and cut his wife's head off?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.880
-是 但我是说除了这点之外… -不好意思
- Yeah, but, I mean, apart from that... - Excuse me.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.320

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.240
怎么回事？
What's happened?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.640
这条路的程序我还没写
Well, I haven't programmed that pathway yet.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.120
有很多条路？
Lot of paths then?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.320
嗯 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yeah, if it's going to be like the book.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.560
那你打算怎么办？
So, come on. How do you want to go about this?

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.520
-你感兴趣？ -当然啊
- You're... you're interested? - That's what I'm saying.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.240
现在是七月 如果要冲击圣诞节
OK, it's July now, so if we want to hit Christmas,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.880
那我们在十一月就要投入生产
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths by November.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.760
我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal.

108
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.760
Come and write it here.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.080
-这里？ -对啊
- Here? - Yeah!

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.840
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.000
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.760
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.280
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.160
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.560
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960
好
Yes.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.600
完美
Perfect. Perfect.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.720
好 第一件事就是稍微精简一下项目
OK, so the first thing we need to do is streamline the project a little.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.720
做一整本书 体量太大
We can't fit a breeze block of a book into 48K.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.120
看呐
Oh, look at this.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560

Here you go.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.080

Happy Birthday to me.

科林·里特曼？太疯狂了 我玩过他所有游戏
Colin Ritman? That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.880
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
The state of him. He's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.080
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.600
我们之前见过吗？
We've met before?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200
没有
No.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.520
我现在在做这个
This is what I'm working on.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.720
鼻子跳水
Nohzdyve.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.520
没错
Yeah... that's right.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.640
（运行）

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.440
-可恶 -怎么了？
- Oh, bollocks. - What's that?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.560
缓冲区错误
Buffer error.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.640
游戏界面超显存了
The eyeball sprite's overshot the video memory.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.200
你怎么知道？
How did you know that?

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.920
-没怎么啊 -我的天 他很优秀吧？
- Just did. - Bloody hell, he's good, right?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.040
好了 来说正经事 斯蒂芬有东西要演示给我们看
Anyway, let's get down to business. Stefan's got something to demo for us.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.360
用游戏杆做选择 有十秒时间
You choose with the joystick. See. You've got ten seconds.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.320
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.360
-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？ -杰罗姆·戴维斯 太有远见
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i> - Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.920
他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.160
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.880
你是哪个结局？读那本书的时候
Which ending did you get? When you read it.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.360
-全部结局 -不好意思
- All of them. - Excuse me.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.760
（崇拜帕克斯）

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.560
-怎么回事？ -这条路的程序我还没写
- What's happened? - I haven't programmed that path yet.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.920
是哦 有很多条路？
Right. So a lot of paths then?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.640
对 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yes, if it's going to be like the book.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.880
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.480
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.720
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal.

175
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.720
Come and write it here.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.680
-这里？ -我们专门为你安排几张桌子
- Here? - We'll give you a couple of desks,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.760
建一个小团队 当然 科林也在附近
set up a small team, just for you. And of course Col's on hand.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.920
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.040
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.680
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.400
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.040
不
No.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.040
我的意思是 我确实想做你的游戏 但是…
I mean, yes, I want to do your game, but I-I just...

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.400
我只是觉得我需要…
I just think I need-I need to...

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.760
我需要按自己想法来写
I need to write it how I know.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.360
就我一个人 在家里写
You know, just me. At home.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.920
在家里 你一个人？
At home. On your own?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.480
对 现在它全在我脑子里
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080
如果让其他人插手
and I think if I let other people in it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.840
可能会有点压力？

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.520
“有点压力”？
"Stressy"?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.320
但我知道自己肯定能做好
But I know that I can do it proper justice.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.440
对得起这本书
The book.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.280
各种不同的故事线 平行现实
You know, divergent story paths. Parallel realities.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.040
-但它也只是个游戏吧？ -我明白
- It's still a game though, yeah? - I get it.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.160
这小子是个匠人
The lad's a craftsman.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.920
孤独的林中居民 我也是
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.920
-可是… -如我所说
- Yeah, but... - It's like I say,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.520
团队适合做动作游戏
teams are fine for things like action titles,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.360
但涉及到玩概念的游戏
but when it's a concept piece,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.240
就需要一点点疯狂 最好是一个人来想
bit of madness is what you need and that works best when it's one mind.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.120
好了 蒂莫西·利里 我们晚点再议论《知觉之门》
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate <i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.600
那是赫胥黎的书 不是利里
That was Huxley not Leary.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.280
如果你要自己写
If you're going to write this on your tod, the important thing is

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.080
那重要的是 圣诞需要有成品
putting it out for Christmas, so I'll need finished code by 12th September.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.680
所以9月12日前要编码完毕

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.640
-好 可以 -不能晚
- OK, sure. - But no later.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.680
你都听些什么？
What do you listen to?

207
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.040
- Hmm? - To get in to the flow.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.120
以便让自己进入心流

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.400
音乐啊？
Oh, music?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.120
汤姆森双胞胎乐团
Er... Thompson Twins.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.640
拿支笔
Get a pen.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.360
我在解冻肉馅
I'm defrosting mince.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.240
这东西真是黑科技
It's like alien technology, this thing.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.480
情况顺利吗？
Oh. How... How did it go?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.520
挺好的 很顺利
Er, good. Yeah, really good.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.720
他们收了
- They're taking it. - Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.880
-太棒了 -是啊

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.920
-很厉害 -你手上有肉汁
- Well done, mate. - You've got mince juice on your hands.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.880
嗯
Yes.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.520
那是怎样安排？ 你去他们办公室还是？
So, how does it work then? Do you go into their office, or...?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.120
不去 我在这里写
No, I write it here.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.200
-自己一个人？ -嗯
- On-on your own? - Yes.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.280
这个…
And...

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.280
这种工作这样做好吗？
Is that the best way to work on something like this?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.680
为什么不好？
Why wouldn't it be?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.240
画面做得确实很厉害 罗宾
<i>Well, the graphics</i> <i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.400
但一个大问题是 玩起来怎么样？
<i>but the big question is,</i> <i>what's it like to play?</i>

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.560
游戏玩法也一样很厉害
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive.</i>

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.320
我必须说 这是科林·里特曼的游戏 所以大家期待不低
<i>I must say, this is a Colin Ritman game,</i> <i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.200
但哪怕以他的标准来看 这游戏也确实非常好
<i>but even by his standards</i> <i>this is really most impressive.</i>

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.080
游戏很有挑战 需要不断学习
<i>It's challenging,</i> <i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.240
玩家会死很多次 必须多次尝试 但我并不怎么介意
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i> <i>but I didn't really mind that much.</i>

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.160
（《看门 拿钥匙》）
<i>So it sounds great</i> <i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.320
听起来很棒 罗宾 你的评定是？

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.040
满分五星 我给四星 科林·里特曼再次成功了
<i>Four stars out of five.</i> <i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.120
-所以还不够完美 -没有什么是完美无缺的
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i> <i>- </i>Well, nothing's perfect.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.120
我在那里 那边是科林·里特曼…
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.040
“真正的科林·里特曼” 我记得你是这样说的
"The actual Colin Ritman," I believe you called him.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:21.320
没错 而且塔克尔先生给我机会
Yeah, exactly. And Mr. Thakur's offering me the chance to work there

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
可以去他们办公室 在科林身边工作
in their own office alongside Colin.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.360
而我…
And I just...

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.240
-不知道 有点太过… -太过？
- I don't know. It was too... - Too?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.000
太过理想 不像是真的
Good to be true.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.000
-我拒绝了 -你拒绝了？
- I said no. - You said no?

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.880
不是拒绝一整件事
Well, not to the whole thing,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.600
只是拒绝去那里工作 在其控制之下
just to working there, being under their control.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.320
不知道为什么 我就说了“不”
I don't know where it came from, I just said no

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.000
然后必须给自己找理由 说自己喜欢独自工作
and then had to justify it by saying that I prefer to work alone.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.600
我只是不知道哪来的那股冲动
But I just don't know where the urge to say it came from.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.040
你听起来越来越自信了 这是好迹象
It sounds like you're growing in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.000
他们还是让我做游戏 所以…
Well, they're still letting me do the game, so...

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.520
做得好 斯蒂芬 太棒了
Well done, Stefan. That's great. That's great.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.720
你和我爸说的话一样
You sound like my dad.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.640
哦
Oh.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.960
抱歉
Sorry.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.600
他有时会让我觉得很烦
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.400
比如这个 我现在已经没事了
Like this... I'm fine now,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.240
我不懂为什么还要来参加这些治疗
I don't see why I need to keep coming to these sessions.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.360
我不知道 好像有种受到监控的感觉
It just feels like being... I don't know, monitored.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.440
也许是因为周年快到了 所以你有受到侵扰的感觉
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon because of the anniversary looming.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.160
每年这时间你都不好受 这点不能小看
It's a difficult time of year for you. We can't underestimate that.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.440
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.520
回顾往事可能会有帮助 哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
It can be helpful to revisit things. Even if you feel you've done this before.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.440
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.480
我一直想起那天早上
I keep thinking about that morning.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.520
再次经历那天的事
Reliving it.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.120
兔子
<i>Rabbit.</i>

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480
是因为兔子
<i>It was because of Rabbit.</i>

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.640
就是我妈在我出生时 给我做的那个傻玩具
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i> <i>had made for me when I was born.</i>

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.320
我曾经和它寸步不离
I used to take him everywhere.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.600
爸爸可能觉得这样有点女气
I think Dad thought it was sissy or something.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.080
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.720
他和妈妈经常因为这个大吵
<i>He and Mum used to</i> <i>have these rows about it.</i>

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.360
他都五岁了 不该玩娃娃了
By five, he should've stopped playing with dolls.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.720
我知道他拿走了兔子 藏了起来
<i>I know he took rabbit away</i> <i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.080
那天早上 妈妈去看望外公外婆
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i> <i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.920
本来我也要去 但我找不到兔子了
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i> <i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.960
没有兔子 我拒绝出门
<i>And I refused to go without him.</i>

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.800
快 斯蒂芬 我们要迟到了
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.400
你来还是不来？
Are you coming or not?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.440
不去
No!

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.480
快走吧 现在得赶8点45的车了
Come on. You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.040
我拖延了她的时间
<i>So I held her up.</i>

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.240
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车 都是因为我
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i> <i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.840
斯蒂芬 你当时几岁？
Stefan, how old were you when this happened?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.840
五岁
Five.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.760
你当时才五岁
You were five years old.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.680
你也不可能预见会发生什么
And you couldn't have known.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.760
你不可能预见会发生什么
You couldn't have known.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.680
急救部门称 8点45分的高速列车脱轨
<i>The Emergency Services say</i> <i>the 8:45 train derailed</i>

288
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.800
<i>at high speed</i> <i>outside Queenstown Road Station.</i>

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.480
就在皇后镇路车站外面

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.080
死亡人数继续攀升
<i>As the death toll continues to rise,</i> <i>transport police have opened an inquiry,</i>

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.160
交警已开始调查 但起因尚不清楚

290
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.040
<i>but the cause is not yet clear.</i>

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.920
我为这件事恨死他了
I fucking hate him for it.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.960
往事无法改变 斯蒂芬
The past is immutable, Stefan.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.960
无论多痛苦 我们都改变不了事情
No matter how painful it is, we can't change things,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.880
事后回想 我们也无法做出不同选择
we can't choose differently, with hindsight.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.920
我们都得学会接受现实
We all have to learn to accept that.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.360

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.360
-我没抽过… -来吧
- Oh. I haven't ever really... - Come on.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.000
你会习惯的
You'll get the hang of that.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.360
一个给你
One for you...

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.320
一个给我
One for me.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:23.200
-什么东西？ -能让你看到大局
- What is it? - It lets you see the bigger picture.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.400
-我不懂 -能帮你理解
- I-I don't know. - It'll help you understand.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.760
想要吗？
Do you want it?

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
你来抉择
It's your choice.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.560
完全看你的 不要有压力
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.400
想
Yes.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.440
这样做
Do this.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.680
现在呢？
Now what?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.600
现在等着就好
Now we just wait a bit.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.360
人们以为只有一种现实
People think there's one reality

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.720
但其实有许多种 像根系一样交织
but there's loads of them, all snaking off, like roots.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.440
我们在一条路线上的行为 会影响到其他路线
And what we do on one path affects what happens on the other paths.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.520
时间是一种构造
Time is a construct.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.760
大家以为无法回到过去 改变事情
People think you can't go back and change things,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.920
但其实可以 记忆闪回就是这种情况
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.880
它们就是邀请人回到过去 做出不一样的抉择
they're invitations to go back and make different choices.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.960
你在做决定时 以为是自己做出的决定 并非如此
When you make a decision, you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.800
而是那些与我们世界相连接的灵魂
It's the spirit out there that's connected to our world

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.600
决定着我们要做什么
that decides what we do

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.240
我们只要随波逐流就好
and we just have to go along for the ride.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.240
镜子让人穿行时间
Mirrors let you move through time.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.960
政府监控着大家
The government monitors people,

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560
花钱雇人假装你的亲戚
they pay people to pretend to be your relatives

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.760
在你食物里下药 拍摄你
and they put drugs in your food and they film you.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.040
每个游戏里都有讯息
There's messages in every game.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.760
比如吃豆人 你知道游戏名PAC代表什么吗？
Like Pac-Man. Do you know what PAC stands for?

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.000
PAC即“规划与控制”
P-A-C: "Program and Control."

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.920
吃豆人其实就是规划与控制者 整个游戏都是一种隐喻
He's Program and Control Man, the whole thing's a metaphor,

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.040
他以为自己有自由意志 但其实是困在迷宫里
he thinks he's got free will but really he's trapped in a maze,

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.360
困在体系里 只能吃吃吃
in a system, all he can do is consume,

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.600
追逐他的恶魔 大概是他假想出来的
he's pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head,

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.680
就算他从迷宫一侧逃离出来了
and even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze,

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.640
又会发生什么？
what happens? He comes right back in the other side.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.680
他马上又从另一侧回到了迷宫里

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.000
大家以为这是个开心的游戏
People think it's a happy game,

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.000
但并非如此 那是个噩梦世界
it's not a happy game, it's a fucking nightmare world

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.520
最糟糕的是 那世界是真实的 我们都活在其中
and the worst thing is it's real and we live in it.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.240
全是代码
It is all code.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.560
仔细听的话 能听到数字
If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.960
宇宙有一张流程图 决定了你可以去哪 不可以去哪
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can and where you can't go.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.160
我已经给了你这份知识 让你自由了
I've given you the knowledge. I've set you free.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.560
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.840
也许吧
Maybe.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.960
嗯 算是吧
Yes. Sort of.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.040
我让你看看我是什么意思 跟我来
I'll show you what I mean. Come with me.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.600
我们在一条路线上
We're on one path.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.680
现在的我和你
Right now, me and you.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.160
一条路线如何终结并不重要
And how one path ends is immaterial.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:18.080
重要的是我们在这条路线上的决定 对整体造成的影响
It's how our decisions along that path affect the whole that matters.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.160
你相信我吗？
Do you believe me?

627
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.520
I don't know.

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.520
不知道

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.280
我证明给你看
I'll prove it.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.520
我们中的一个人过去
One of us is going over.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.840
过去那边
Over there.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.320
你会死的
You'd die. You'd die.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.200
不重要 因为还有其他时间线 斯蒂芬
It wouldn't matter because there are other timelines, Stefan.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.560
你看到吃豆人死过多少次了？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.360
对他没什么影响
Doesn't bother him.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.920
他重新来过就好
He just tries again.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.960
我们俩之间的一个人要跳 是谁？
One of us is jumping, so who's it going to be?

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.840
上面凉风习习
It's a nice breeze up here.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.080
来吧 我们俩谁跳？
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.080
我来
I'll do it.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.840
我喜欢你的风格
I like your style.

641
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.800
Oh! Oh!

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.520
（四个月后）

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.320
（全新干净石板）

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.000
（潘达斯奈基）

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.920
潘达斯奈基（塔克软件 6.95英镑）

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.480
罗宾 《潘达斯奈基》有何优点吗？
<i>So, Robin, Bandersnatch, any good?</i>

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.200
难说 因为你也知道
<i>This is hard to say,</i> <i>because as you may know,</i>

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.040
游戏原作者在悲剧事件中死亡
<i>the original author of this game</i> <i>was killed in a tragic accident.</i>

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.960
-是啊 -但游戏就是不怎么好
- <i>Indeed.</i> <i>- But it's just not a good game.</i>

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.240
好像是其他人赶制出来的 非常突兀<i> </i>不和谐
<i>It seems someone else finished it off</i> <i>quickly but it's just abrupt and jarring.</i>

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:23.320
多余 可怕 暴力 不安 诡异
<i>And unnecessary, and horrible,</i> <i>and violent, unsettling, and weird,</i>

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.720
糟糕 骇人 黑暗 阴郁 惊悚…
<i>and awful, and scary, and dark,</i> <i>and bleak and creepy...</i>

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.840
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i> <i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.960
比憋在心里 要更健康
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.440
你得和她谈谈
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.840
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i> <i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.720

你跳
You do it.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.160
好
Fair enough.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.240
再见
See you around.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.880
科林在哪？
Where's Colin?

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.840
到了
We're here.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.800
-科林跳了下去 我没阻止他 -斯蒂芬
- Colin jumped and I didn't stop him. - Stefan...

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.280
你的状况可能不太好
maybe you're not well.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.880
去和海恩斯医生谈谈
Go and speak to Dr. Haynes.

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.240
求你了
Please.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:28.960
好
Alright.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.760
什么样的事情？
What sort of things?

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.960
早餐吃什么 听什么音乐
What I have for breakfast. What music I listen to.

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.640
咬不咬指甲
Whether I bite my fucking nails.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.200
-你感觉自己不是… -作出这些决定的人
- You feel you're not... - Making these decisions, no,

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.280
我们之前谈过这个 我很肯定
and we've talked about this before. I'm sure we have.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.160
你说我对妈妈的死感到内疚 提高了我的药量
And you tell me I feel guilty about my mum and you up my dose.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.520
我确实有在吃药 好吧？
And, yes, I am taking my medication, OK?

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.280
快点给我开他妈的处方
So just write me the fucking prescription.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.640

复制不够快 人人都想要科林·里特曼的游戏
We can't dupe them fast enough. Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.800
-科林呢？ -逃班了
- Where is Colin? - He's gone AWOL.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.960
大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam for a spot of gardening,

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.720
你懂我意思吧 他会回来的 总是如此
if you know what I mean. He'll be back, he always is.

戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
<i>Davies became convinced</i> <i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i> <i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.480
那么你的任何行为都是无罪的
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i> <i>from your actions.</i>

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.560
那些行为甚至并非是你自己的
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.520
在你控制之外
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.840
你的命运被人主宰
<i>Your fate has been dictated.</i>

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.000
所以 杀人有什么不可以？
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.960

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.440
外面卖的卷烟都有士的宁 闹笑话的人是他
Yeah, well, pre-rolled have strychnine in them, so the joke's on him.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.600
随便了 这位是斯蒂芬…
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.560
巴特勒
Butler, Butler.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:35.920
我是科林
I'm Colin, yeah.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.240
嗯 我玩过你所有游戏 全部所有
Yeah, I've played all of your games. All of them.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:42.920
除了康懋达电脑上的那些 我没有康懋达电脑
Except the Commodore ones, I don't have a Commodore.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.880
-康懋达电脑声卡不错 -是啊
- Great sound chip, the Commodore. - Mm-hm.

1017
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:47.880
Yeah.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.800
这是我最新的游戏
This is my latest.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.920
（运行）

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.480
叫鼻子跳水
It's called Nohzdyve.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.640
-游戏界面真流畅 -花了一些功夫
- The sprites are so smooth. - That took some doing.

01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.040
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.880
-怎么了？ -缓冲区错误
- What's that? - It's a buffer error.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.520
显存超了
The eyeballs have overrun the video memory, and...

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.880
是啊 显存 我正要说呢
Oh, yeah, yeah, video memory, yeah. I was gonna say that.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.880
这样 说正经事吧
Anyway, listen, let's get down to business.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.320
斯蒂芬要给我们演示点东西
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.680
厉害了
Bloody hell.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.720
就像三维怪物迷宫？
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.640
不过人是在不断进行选择
Only when you're moving from choice to choice.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.840
-其实是一个探险游戏 -像《霍比特人》
- It's actually an adventure game. - Like<i> The Hobbit.</i>

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.920
嗯 但不用打字
Yes, but without any typing.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.720
不用打字？ 所以不会有“找灯”什么的？
Without any typing? So no "get lamp" or whatever?

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.200
对
That's right.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.920
屏幕上出现选择 倒计时内确定就行
Choices come up on the screen and you pick one against the clock.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.200
（弱小的人类 要崇拜我吗？）

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.160
他是恶魔帕克斯 是书里的
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon. He's in the book.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.040
我们其实到了一个选择点
So we've actually arrived at a choice point,

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.960
用游戏杆进行选择
and then you can choose with the joystick.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.560
有十秒时间
You've got ten seconds.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.200
崇拜他
Worship him.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.360
不要这样 他是命运的窃贼
No, don't do that, he's the Thief of Destiny, in the book, I mean.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.920
我是说 在书里

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.720
我家里有一本 但从没读过
Got a copy of this at home. Never got around to reading it.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.440
你应该读读 杰罗姆·戴维斯是天才
You should. Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.160
他不是发疯了 砍下了妻子的头吗？
Didn't he go bonkers and cut his wife's head off?

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.440
-是 但我是说除了这点之外… -不好意思
- Yeah, but I mean, apart from that... - Excuse me.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:23.920
（崇拜帕克斯）

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.480
（超出范围）

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.880
怎么回事？
What's happened?

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.240
这条路的程序我还没写
Well, I haven't programmed that pathway yet.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.160
有很多条路？
Lot of paths then?

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.760
嗯 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yeah, if it's going to be like the book.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.760
那你打算怎么办？
So, come on. How do you want to go about this?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.160
-你感兴趣？ -当然啊
- You're... you're interested? - That's what I'm saying.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.880
现在是七月 如果要冲击圣诞节
OK, it's July now, so if we want to hit Christmas,

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.960
那我们在十一月就要投入生产
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths by November.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.400
我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.720
-这里？ -对啊
- Here? - Yeah!

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.480
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.640
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.360
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:04.920
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.800
所以音乐我们可以解决 全在公司内部做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.200
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.400
（1984年7月9日）

1061
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.400
<i>♪ Relax, don't... ♪</i>

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.400
吃早餐吗？
Breakfast?

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.120
潘达什么？
- Your Bander-what? - Bandersnatch.

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.040
潘达斯奈基 这本书是“选择自己的冒险”
- It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. - That bloody hound from next door!

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.600
隔壁那条该死的猎犬 真是烦死人了

1065
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.520
Be the death of us.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.360
（朋友  没有未来）
<i>♪ I want to breathe in the open wind ♪</i>

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.080
（塔克软件）
<i>♪ I want to kiss like... ♪</i>

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.000
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:45.280
科林·里特曼？太疯狂了 我玩过他所有游戏
Colin Ritman? That's crazy. I've played all of his games.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.240
看看他这状态 今年赚的钱都够买兰博基尼了
State of him, he's made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.440
但还是抽自己卷的烟
and he still smokes roll-ups.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.520
-我们之前见过 -没有
- We've met before. - No.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.840
我现在在做这个
This is what I'm working on.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.880
-鼻子跳水 -没错
- Nohzdyve. - Yeah. That's right.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.000
（运行）

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.120
可恶
Oh, bollocks.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.880
-怎么了？ -缓冲区错误
- What's that? - Buffer error.

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.000
游戏界面超显存了
Those eyeball sprites overshot the video memory.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.560
你怎么知道
How did you know that?

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.280
-没怎么啊 -我的天 他很优秀吧？
- Just did. - Bloody hell, he's good, right?

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.320
好了 来说正经事 斯蒂芬有东西要演示给我们看
Anyway, let's get down to business. Stefan's got something to demo for us.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.720
用游戏杆做选择 有十秒时间
You choose with the joystick. See. You've got ten seconds.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.840
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.720
-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？ -杰罗姆·戴维斯 很有远见
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i> - Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.840
他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.520
对 大家都倾向于关注这一点
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.280
你是哪个结局？读那本书的时候
Which ending did you get? When you read it.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.720
-全部结局 -不好意思
- All of them. - Excuse me.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.160
（崇拜帕克斯）

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.920
-怎么回事？ -这条路的程序我还没写
- What's happened? - I haven't programmed that path yet.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.280
是哦 有很多条路？
Right. So, a lot of paths then?

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:05.000
对 如果按书里来 就会这样
Well, yes, if it's going to be like the book.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.680
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.840
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.080
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.000
这里？
Here?

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.640
我们专门为你安排几张桌子 建一个小团队
We'll give you a couple of desks, set up a small team, just for you.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.120
当然 科林也在附近
And of course Col's on hand.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.240
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.400
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.840
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.760
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480
不
No.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:48.760
我的意思是 我确实想做你的游戏 但是…
I mean, yes, I want to do your game. I just... I just think I need to...

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.240
我需要按自己想法来写
I need to write it how I know.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:59.720
就我一个人 在家里写
You know, just me. At home.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.280
在家里 你一个人？
At home. On your own?

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.960
对 现在它全在我脑子里
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.320
如果让其他人插手
and I think if I let other people in, it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.200
可能会有点压力？

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.360
“有点压力”？
"Stressy"?

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.760
但我知道自己肯定能做好 对得起这本书
But I know that I can do it proper justice. The book.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.640
各种不同的故事线 平行现实
You know, divergent story paths. Parallel realities.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.400
-但它也只是个游戏吧？ -我明白
- It's still a game though, yeah? - I get it.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.520
这小子是个匠人
The lad's a craftsman.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:29.280
孤独的林中居民 我也是
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.280
-可是… -如我所说
- Yeah, but... - It's like I say,

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:33.920
团队适合做动作游戏
teams are fine for things like action titles,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.800
但涉及到玩概念的游戏
but when it's a concept piece,

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.600
就需要一点点疯狂 最好是一个人来想
bit of madness is what you need and that works best when it's one mind.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.480
好了 蒂莫西·利里 我们晚点再议论《知觉之门》
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate <i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.240
-那是赫胥黎的书 不是利里 -如果你要自己写
That was Huxley, not Leary.

1120
01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.400
If you're going to write this on your tod,

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.560
那重要的是 圣诞需要有成品
the important thing is putting it out for Christmas,

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.040
所以9月12日前要编码完毕
so I'll need finished code by 12th September.

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.000
-好 可以 -不能晚
- OK, sure. - But no later.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.960
你都听些什么？
What do you listen to?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.480
以便让自己进入心流
To get in to the flow.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.720
音乐啊？
Oh, music?

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.120
主要是合辑
Er, compilations mainly.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.960
拿支笔
Get a pen.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:24.800
我在解冻肉馅
I'm defrosting mince.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.600
这东西真是黑科技
It's like alien technology this thing.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.840
情况顺利吗？
Oh. How... how did it go?

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.880
挺好的 很顺利
Good. Yeah, really good.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.080
他们收了
They're taking it.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.680
-太棒了 -是啊
Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.280
-很厉害 -你手上有肉汁
- Well done, mate. - You've got mince juice on your hands.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.240
嗯
Yes.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:00.040
那是怎样安排？ 你去他们办公室还是？
So, how does it work then? Do you go into their office, or...?

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.480
不去 我在这里写
No, I write it here.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.560
-自己一个人？ -嗯
- On your own? - Yes.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.680
这个…
And...

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.640
这种工作这样做好吗？
Is that the best way to work on something like this?

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.240
为什么不好？
Why wouldn't it be?

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.600
画面做得确实很厉害 罗宾
<i>Well, the graphics</i> <i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.760
但一个大问题是 玩起来怎么样？
<i>but the big question is,</i> <i>what's it like to play?</i>

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.160
游戏玩法也一样很厉害
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive,</i> <i>I must say.</i>

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.680
这是科林·里特曼的游戏 所以大家期待不低
<i>This is a Colin Ritman game,</i> <i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.560
但哪怕以他的标准来看 这游戏也确实非常好
<i>but even by his standards</i> <i>this is really most impressive.</i>

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.400
游戏很有挑战 需要不断学习
<i>It's challenging,</i> <i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.600
玩家会死很多次 必须多次尝试 但我并不怎么介意
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i> <i>but I really didn't mind that much.</i>

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.680
听起来很棒 罗宾 你的评定是？
<i>So it sounds great</i> <i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.400
满分五星 我给四星 科林·里特曼再次成功了
<i>Four stars out of five.</i> <i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.480
-所以还不够完美 -没有什么是完美无缺的
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i> <i>- Well, nothing's perfect.</i>

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.480
我在那里 那边是科林·里特曼…
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.960
“真正的科林·里特曼” 我记得你是这样说的
"The actual Colin Ritman," I believe you called him.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:03.680
没错 而且塔克尔先生给我机会
Yeah, exactly, and Mr. Thakur's offering me the chance to work there

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.760
可以去他们办公室 在科林身边工作
in their own office alongside Colin.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.800
而我…
And I just...

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.600
-不知道 有点太过… -太过？
- I don't know. It was too... - Too?

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.440
太过理想 不像是真的
Good to be true.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.360
-我拒绝了 -你拒绝了？
- I said no. - You said "no"?

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.240
不是拒绝一整件事
Well, not to the whole thing,

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.160
只是拒绝去那里工作 在其控制之下
just to working there and being under their control.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.640
不知道为什么
I don't know where it came from,

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.920
我就说了“不” 然后必须给自己找理由
I just said "no" and then had to justify it

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.360
说自己喜欢独自工作
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.960
我只是不知道哪来的那股冲动
But I just don't know where the urge to say it came from.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.400
你听起来越来越自信了 这是好迹象
It sounds like you're growing in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.360
他们还是让我做游戏 所以…
Well, they're still letting me do the game, so...

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.680
做得好 斯蒂芬 太棒了
Well done, Stefan. That's great.

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.080

You sound like my dad.

Oh.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.320
抱歉
Sorry.

He gets on my nerves sometimes.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.760
比如这个 我现在已经没事了
Like this... I'm fine now,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.560
我不懂为什么还要来参加这些治疗
I don't see why I need to keep coming to these sessions.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.720
我不知道 好像有种受到监控的感觉
It just feels like being, I don't know, monitored.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.760
也许是因为周年快到了 所以你有受到侵扰的感觉
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon because of the anniversary looming.

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.520
每年这段时间你都不好受 这点不能小看
It's a difficult time of year for you. We can't underestimate that.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.800
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:45.880
回顾往事可能会有帮助 哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
It can be helpful to revisit things. Even if you feel you've done this before.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.760
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.880

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.200
-科林呢？ -鬼知道 逃班了
- Where is Colin? - God knows. He's gone AWOL.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.680
人没来 电话也不接
He hasn't come in, answered his phone. Par for the course from him.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.360
他这样也不是一次两次了

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.440
大概去阿姆斯特丹找园艺地点了
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam for a spot of gardening.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:34.040
他会回来的 总是如此
He'll be back, he always is. Anyway, come on.

If it's something you've added, let's just take it out.

I just need the weekend. I know I can squeeze this path in.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.360

- It's complicated enough. - Just the weekend. Please.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.720

戴维斯每日自行服用致幻剂
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i> <i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.480
再加上他努力想要完成

成为了压垮他的最后一根稻草
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.520
他痴迷于诡异的符号
<i>He became obsessed</i> <i>with bizarre symbols</i>

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.640
以及他自身自由意志之限制
<i>and the limitations</i> <i>of his own free will.</i>

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.360
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
<i>In his notes,</i> <i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.640
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i> <i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.520
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
<i>It was the start</i> <i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.040
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
<i>Davies became convinced</i> <i>he had no control over his fate</i>

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.440
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i> <i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.640
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
<i>at the behest of a demon called Pax,</i> <i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.000
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.640
最后也把恶魔写进了书里

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.040

我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
<i>we exist within</i> <i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
<i>One reality for each possible course</i> <i>of action we might take in life.</i>

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.520
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.840
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择
<i>there’s another one out there</i> <i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.880
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i> <i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.600

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.760
-我现在在做这个 -鼻子跳水
- This is what I'm working on. - Nohzdyve.

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.560
-可恶 -怎么了？
- Oh, bollocks. - What's that?

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.360
缓冲区错误 游戏界面超显存了
Buffer error. The eyeball sprites overshot the video memory.

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.760
对
Yep.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.160
（弱小的人类 要崇拜我吗？）

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.600
别崇拜他 他是命运之窃贼
Don't worship him, he's the Thief of Destiny.

-你读过《潘达斯奈基》？ -杰罗姆·戴维斯 有远见
- You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i> - Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

他就是那个发了疯 把老婆脑袋砍掉的家伙？
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo and cut his wife's head off?

-怎么回事？ -这条路的程序我还没写
- What's happened? - I haven't programmed that path yet.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.480
书里有很多不同的现实
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.640
这本书很超前 因为时间是存在的
It was ahead of its time. In as much as time exists.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.880
好 我的提议是 你来这里写程序
OK. So here's my proposal. Come and write it here.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:48.840
-这里？ -我们专门为你安排几张桌子
- Here? - We'll give you a couple of desks,

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:51.920
建一个小团队 当然 科林也在附近
set up a small team, just for you. And of course Col's on hand.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.080
你怎么想？
What do you reckon?

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.200
对了 我下周会雇用一个做声卡的
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.640
所以音乐我们可以解决 全都内部来做
so music we can take care of. All in-house.

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:02.520
说吧 你怎么看？
So, come on. What's your answer?

01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:05.840
-不 -需要一点点疯狂
- No. - Bit of madness is what you need.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.160
你想谈谈你母亲吗？
Would you like to talk about your mother?

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.320
一切都还好吗？
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.160

Look, I can't help if you just sit there and don't speak!

爸 滚出去
Dad, just fuck off!

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.840
拿上外套 我们出去吃午饭
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:33.160
-这是海恩斯医生的地方 -你得和她谈谈
- This is Dr. Haynes' place. - You need to speak to her.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:38.080
你压力太大了 你不吃东西 不睡觉
You're under pressure. You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.600
我觉得 把心里的顾虑说出来
I think the healthiest thing to do is to talk about any concerns you may have

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:46.920
比憋在心里 要更健康
instead of bottling them up inside.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.800
我们之前谈过这个 我很肯定
We've talked about this before. I'm sure we have.

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.160
快点给我开他妈的处方
So just write me the fucking prescription.

Don't fuck up. There's a lot riding on this now.

（杰罗姆片子）

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.720
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
<i>We exist within</i> <i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.320
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
<i>One reality for each possible course</i> <i>of action we might take in life.</i>

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.160
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i> <i>in this existence,</i>

01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.280
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择
<i>there’s another one out there</i> <i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.720
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i> <i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.120
一切只不过是幻觉

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.840

- This is Dr. Haynes' place. - You need to speak to her.

02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:45.960
不去
No!

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:49.040
快走吧 现在得赶8点45的车了
Come on. You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:52.520
我拖延了她的时间
<i>So I held her up.</i>

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.720
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车 都是因为我
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i> <i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:01.320
斯蒂芬 你当时几岁？
Stefan, how old were you when this happened?

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.320
五岁
Five.

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.240
你当时才五岁
You were five years old.

02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:10.120
你也不可能预见会发生什么
And you couldn't have known.

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.320
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

你不可能预见会发生什么

02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.920
就在皇后镇路车站外面

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.400
死亡人数继续攀升

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.360
我为这件事恨死他了
I fucking hate him for it.

02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.400
往事无法改变 斯蒂芬
The past is immutable, Stefan.

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:47.440
无论多痛苦 我们都改变不了事情
No matter how painful it is, we can't change things,

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.400
事后回想 我们也无法做出不同选择
we can't choose differently, with hindsight.

02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.440
我们都得学会接受现实
And we all have to learn to accept that.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.840
记住 需要我就给我打电话
Remember. Any time you need me, just pick up the phone.

02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.800
你知道号码
You know the number.

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.640

Stefan?

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.880
-你能和我谈谈吗？ -爸 滚出去
- Will you talk to me? - Dad, just fuck off!

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:34.440
拿上外套 我们出去吃午饭
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.520
不
No.

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.240
这样做又有什么好处？
What good does it do?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.160
不断回忆往事
Going over things again and again.

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:45.440
仔细想想
Think carefully.

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.480
你可能真的会有新发现
You really might learn something new.

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.360
我再问一次
So I'll ask again.

02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:55.400
你想谈谈母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.600
你可能会更了解自己 说不定的
You might learn something about yourself you don't know.

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.920
我一直想起那天早上
I keep thinking about that morning.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:13.880
再次经历那天的事

兔子 是因为兔子
<i>Rabbit. It was because of Rabbit.</i>

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:21.040
就是我妈在我出生时 给我做的那个傻玩具
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i> <i>had made for me when I was born.</i>

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.720
我曾经和它寸步不离
I used to take him everywhere.

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.000
爸爸可能觉得这样有点女气
I think Dad thought it was sissy or something.

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.400
那又怎样 兔子只是个玩具

02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:32.120
他和妈妈经常因为这个大吵
<i>He and Mum used to have</i> <i>these rows about it.</i>

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.600
他都五岁了 不该玩娃娃了
<i>And by five</i> <i>he should've stopped playing with dolls.</i>

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.280
我知道他拿走了兔子 藏了起来
<i>I know he took Rabbit away</i> <i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:44.480
那天早上 妈妈去看望外公外婆
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i> <i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:48.320
本来我也要去 但我找不到兔子了
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i> <i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.360
没有兔子 我拒绝出门
<i>I refused to go without him.</i>

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.200

<i>He became obsessed</i> <i>with bizarre symbols</i>

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.560
以及他自身自由意志之限制
<i>and the limitations</i> <i>of his own free will.</i>

02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.400
戴维斯在笔记里重复勾勒一个符号
<i>In his notes,</i> <i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:44.680
他认为代表着多重命运 可能的现实一分为二
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i> <i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:49.560
这是他精神完全崩溃的开始
<i>It was the start</i> <i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:53.080
戴维斯深信自己对命运毫无控制
<i>Davies became convinced</i> <i>he had no control over his fate</i>

02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.480
因为妻子在狮形恶魔帕克斯的指使下
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i> <i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:01.520
给他服用大量的精神刺激药
<i>at behest of a demon called Pax,</i> <i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:03.040
他声称自己见过这个恶魔
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:05.720
最后也把恶魔写进了书里
<i>and who ended up</i> <i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.080
他就是因为这个才杀了妻子
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:13.160
砍下她的头
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i> <i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:16.320
用她的血在墙上画满了那个符号

02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:20.440
他被逮捕后 对警察说
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:25.000
我们同时存在于多重平行现实里
<i>we exist within</i> <i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:29.840
每一种现实对应着 我们在人生中可能采取的行动
<i>One reality for each possible course</i> <i>of action we might take in life.</i>

02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.560
无论我们在这个现实里作何选择
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i> <i>in this existence,</i>

02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:35.800
在另一个现实里 我们都作出了相反的选择
<i>there’s another one out there</i> <i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:38.960
这也使得“自由意志”毫无意义
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i> <i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:40.760
一切只不过是幻觉

03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:47.480
所以我回头去除了许多选择

03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:51.480
现在他们以为有自由意志

03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:46.320
-科林在哪？ -我以为你知道呢
Where's Colin?
- I thought you'd tell me. - He's gone, he's just gone.

03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:47.760
他不见了

03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:50.160
我知道 但他之前也这样做过
Tell me about it, but he's done this before.

03:49:50.720 --> 03:49:53.040
这次不一样 你上次见到他是什么时候？
Not like this. When did you see him last?

03:49:53.400 --> 03:49:56.000
就是他把录像带给我 让我拿给斯蒂芬的时候
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:57.680
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:49:57.880 --> 03:49:59.480
别牵扯斯蒂芬进来 他在工作
Let's leave Stefan out of this, he's working.

03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:01.440
斯蒂芬是谁？
Who's Stefan?

03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:22.080
你需要帮手
Well, you need a hand.

03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:27.680

03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:34.320
你在哪工作？楼上？
Where's your pit? Up there?

03:50:44.320 --> 03:50:45.840
我的天
Fucking hell.

03:50:46.400 --> 03:50:48.080
你直直掉到洞里了 兄弟
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:50.320
直直掉下去了
Right down it.

03:50:57.520 --> 03:50:58.760
我杀了我爸
I killed my dad.

03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:01.800
好吧
Right.

03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:07.320
那你是要放我走还是杀了我？
So are you gonna let me go, or are you gonna kill me?

03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:15.680
这是你的选择
I mean, it's your choice.

03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:18.520
完全由你来选择
In as much as you have any choice.

03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:34.400
这样大概有点虎头蛇尾
Imagine that's a bit anti-climactic for you.

03:51:36.080 --> 03:51:37.480
不过谢谢你了
But appreciated.

03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:39.840

昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now, yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:29.480
塔克软件游戏公司宣布被行政接管
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into administration.

03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:30.680
哪里出问题了呢？
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

03:52:31.440 --> 03:52:34.480
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
<i>Just six months ago,</i> <i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:36.880
一系列热门产品占据榜首

03:52:36.960 --> 03:52:40.960
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i> <i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

03:52:41.440 --> 03:52:43.480
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:47.040
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:49.640
并面临谋杀指控
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

03:52:49.720 --> 03:52:52.000
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
<i>who stands accused</i> <i>of murdering his father</i>

03:52:52.080 --> 03:52:54.000
谋杀了亲生父亲
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

03:52:54.080 --> 03:52:56.600
这使大家质疑
<i>This has raised questions</i> <i>about the judgment</i>

03:52:56.680 --> 03:52:59.480
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

03:52:59.960 --> 03:53:02.800
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:04.760
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:06.880
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

03:53:07.480 --> 03:53:08.720
愿他安息

03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:10.720
但我也是受害者
but I'm a victim, too. Let's try to not forget that.

03:53:10.800 --> 03:53:12.600
不要忘记这一点

03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:17.120
塔克软件另一位门生 著名程序师科林·里特曼
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i> <i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

03:53:17.200 --> 03:53:21.400

What would you say to Stefan, if he could hear you?

03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:27.480
我会说 再试一次

但他在监狱里
But he's in prison.

03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:32.120

03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:40.280
塔克公司永远关上了大门

你什么都没做？

03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:00.880
那你让我拿什么给大家？ 在磁带上放屁？

（《看门 拿钥匙》）

04:01:06.160 --> 04:01:07.160
你是斯蒂芬吗？
Are you Stefan?

04:01:08.400 --> 04:01:09.240
对
Yes.

04:01:10.240 --> 04:01:11.680
我们见过面
We've met before.

04:01:12.280 --> 04:01:13.120
并没有
No, we haven't.

04:01:13.880 --> 04:01:14.800
你知道科林在哪吗？
Do you know where Colin is?

04:01:16.240 --> 04:01:17.080
不知道
No.

04:01:18.840 --> 04:01:21.760
我去了办公室 萨特帕尔说你最后见到他
I was in the office and Satpal said you'd seen him last.

04:01:24.920 --> 04:01:27.400
如果知道他在哪 请告诉我
If you know where he is, please tell me.

04:01:31.760 --> 04:01:32.840
他跳了
He jumped.

04:01:34.480 --> 04:01:35.480
跳了？
Jumped?

04:01:36.520 --> 04:01:37.480
跳哪里？什么？
Jumped where, what?

04:01:38.000 --> 04:01:40.080
跳下了阳台 在你公寓里 然后…
Off the balcony. At your flat, and...

04:01:41.600 --> 04:01:42.640
他跳下去摔了 然后…
He jumped and then he fell and...

04:01:43.560 --> 04:01:45.080
你也在场
And you were there. You were there. You saw the whole thing.

04:01:45.280 --> 04:01:47.160
你也在场 目睹了整件事

04:01:47.640 --> 04:01:48.840
你在说些什么？
What are you on about?

2531
04:01:52.240 --> 04:01:55.600
I wasn't sure if it actually happened.

04:01:53.360 --> 04:01:55.720
我不确定是否真发生了

04:01:57.000 --> 04:01:58.040
你是嗑药了吗？
Are you on something?

04:01:58.920 --> 04:02:00.600
没有
No, no, no. I got rid of them. The pills. I don't know why.

04:02:00.800 --> 04:02:02.760
我把药都丢掉了 不知道为什么

04:02:05.840 --> 04:02:06.720
好吧
Right.

04:02:08.400 --> 04:02:10.080
如果有科林的消息
Well, if you hear from Colin, tell him to ring Kitty.

04:02:10.720 --> 04:02:12.440
-叫他打电话给基蒂 -好 我还有事
OK. I've got to go.

And that's why futurologists believe

将来能够随时随地玩游戏
you'll be able to play the games of the future anywhere.

- Crispin. - Thanks, Leslie.

04:03:29.440 --> 04:03:30.600
谢谢 莱斯莉

04:03:31.320 --> 04:03:35.280
昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now, yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

04:03:35.360 --> 04:03:39.640
塔克软件游戏公司宣布进入清算
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into liquidation.

04:03:40.040 --> 04:03:41.560
哪里出问题了呢？
<i>So what went wrong?</i>

04:03:42.360 --> 04:03:45.400
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
<i>Just six months ago,</i> <i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

04:03:45.480 --> 04:03:47.800
一系列热门产品占据榜首
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

04:03:47.880 --> 04:03:51.880
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i> <i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

04:03:52.360 --> 04:03:54.400
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

04:03:54.480 --> 04:03:58.200
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

04:03:58.280 --> 04:04:00.560
并面临谋杀指控
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

04:04:00.640 --> 04:04:02.920
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
<i>who stands accused</i> <i>of murdering his father</i>

04:04:03.000 --> 04:04:04.920
谋杀了亲生父亲
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

04:04:05.000 --> 04:04:07.600
这使大家质疑
<i>This has raised questions</i> <i>about the judgment</i>

04:04:07.680 --> 04:04:10.400
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

04:04:10.880 --> 04:04:13.720
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

04:04:13.880 --> 04:04:15.680
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:04:16.040 --> 04:04:17.800
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

04:04:18.400 --> 04:04:19.640
愿他安息

04:04:19.920 --> 04:04:21.640
但我也是受害者
but I'm a victim, too. Let's try to not forget that.

04:04:21.720 --> 04:04:23.440
不要忘记这一点

04:04:23.520 --> 04:04:27.760
但塔克软件还有一位门生 处于神秘中心
<i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i> <i>protégé at the center of a mystery.</i>

04:04:27.920 --> 04:04:31.040
著名程序师科林·里特曼 依然下落不明
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i> <i>is still missing,</i>

04:04:31.120 --> 04:04:34.840
他在谋杀事件不久前 突然消失得无影无踪
<i>having vanished without trace</i> <i>shortly before the killings.</i>

04:04:35.280 --> 04:04:37.760
巴特勒在庭审时
<i>At the trial,</i> <i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

04:04:37.840 --> 04:04:40.080
否认与里特曼的突然失踪有关
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

04:04:40.160 --> 04:04:44.440
他声称 在幻觉里看到了里特曼自杀
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i> <i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

04:04:44.720 --> 04:04:47.840
今天 塔克公司永远关上了大门
<i>Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors</i> <i>for good.</i>

04:04:47.920 --> 04:04:50.960
《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

04:05:45.520 --> 04:05:46.920
你需要帮手
Well, you need a hand.

04:05:50.720 --> 04:05:52.520
快 带我过去
Come on, lead me to it.

04:05:53.960 --> 04:05:56.800
-去哪？ -潘达斯奈基
- To what? - Bandersnatch.

04:05:57.400 --> 04:05:59.160
你在哪工作？楼上？
Where's your pit? Up there?

04:06:09.120 --> 04:06:10.600
我的天
Fucking hell.

04:06:11.240 --> 04:06:12.920
你直直掉到洞里了 兄弟
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

04:06:13.920 --> 04:06:15.160
直直掉下去了
Right down it.

04:06:22.480 --> 04:06:23.600
我杀了我爸
I killed my dad.

04:06:25.560 --> 04:06:26.680
好吧
Right.

04:06:29.880 --> 04:06:32.160
那你是要放我走还是杀了我？
So are you gonna let me go, or are you gonna kill me?

04:06:39.040 --> 04:06:40.520
这是你的选择
I mean, it's your choice.

04:06:41.440 --> 04:06:43.320
完全由你来选择
In as much as you have any choice.

04:06:47.200 --> 04:06:48.440
对不起
I'm sorry.

04:06:49.320 --> 04:06:52.440
好吧 争论也没意义
Alright. No point arguing about it.

04:06:52.880 --> 04:06:54.520
不过别用那个 刺着疼
Not with that though. They sting.

04:06:56.600 --> 04:06:57.840
有什么钝器吗？
You got anything blunt?

04:07:02.080 --> 04:07:03.600
先把我打晕
Stun me first.

04:07:04.080 --> 04:07:05.640
人性化一点
Bit more humane.

04:07:16.160 --> 04:07:17.040
试试这个
Try this.

04:07:27.120 --> 04:07:28.600
下份人生再见了
See you in the next life, yeah?

04:07:38.760 --> 04:07:40.080
快 砸我的头
Come on, on me head.

04:07:43.480 --> 04:07:45.360
（微游戏）

04:07:46.600 --> 04:07:48.280
真是令人着迷
That really is fascinating.

04:07:48.360 --> 04:07:51.120
不过还要等许多年
Although we've got many years to go before virtual reality

04:07:51.200 --> 04:07:53.120
虚拟现实才能真正变为现实

六个月前 让我们感到震惊的
Now, six months ago, we were shocked to hear of the murder

04:07:59.800 --> 04:08:02.200
是听闻著名程序师科林·里特曼被杀
of famed programmer Colin Ritman,

04:08:02.280 --> 04:08:06.200
他创造了 金属头、鼻子跳水等诸多游戏
creator of Metl Hedd, Nohzdyve, and many other games.

04:08:06.400 --> 04:08:09.040
今天 凶手终于伏法
Today, his murderer is behind bars.

04:08:09.120 --> 04:08:11.240

But could the crime have been prevented?

No, I'm alright. Thanks, though.

04:10:41.600 --> 04:10:43.560
刚刚只是想让你有选择
Just thought I'd give you the choice.

04:11:02.320 --> 04:11:03.600
别忘了喝茶
- Don't forget your tea. - Cheers.

04:11:04.480 --> 04:11:05.320
谢谢

04:11:32.880 --> 04:11:34.280
你做了什么？
What have you done?

04:11:36.360 --> 04:11:37.720
我替你做了选择
I chose for you.

04:11:39.960 --> 04:11:41.200
你不介意吧？
Are you OK with that?

04:11:42.280 --> 04:11:43.120
不介意
Yeah.

04:12:12.280 --> 04:12:14.280
人们以为只有一种现实
People think there's one reality

04:12:14.440 --> 04:12:16.200
但其实有许多种 像根系一样交织
but there's loads of them, all snaking off, like roots.

04:12:16.280 --> 04:12:18.920
我们在一条路线上的行为 会影响到其他路线
And what you do on one path affects what happens on the other paths.

04:12:19.320 --> 04:12:20.960
时间是一种构造
Time is a construct.

04:12:21.040 --> 04:12:24.160
大家以为无法回到过去 改变事情 但其实可以
People think you can't go back and change things, but you can.

04:12:24.240 --> 04:12:25.400
记忆闪回就是这种情况
That's what flashbacks are.

04:12:25.680 --> 04:12:28.360
它们就是邀请人回到过去 做出不一样的抉择
They're invitations to go back and make different choices.

04:12:28.440 --> 04:12:31.440
你在做决定时 以为是自己做出的决定 并非如此
When you make a decision, you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

04:12:31.520 --> 04:12:34.280
而是那些与我们世界相连接的灵魂
It's the spirit out there that's connected to our world

04:12:34.600 --> 04:12:38.760
决定着我们要做什么 我们只要随波逐流就好
that decides what we do and we just have to go along for the ride.

04:12:39.880 --> 04:12:41.720
镜子让人穿行时间
Mirrors let you move through time.

04:12:42.360 --> 04:12:43.440
政府监控着大家
The government monitors people,

04:12:44.160 --> 04:12:46.040
花钱雇人假装你的亲戚
they pay people to pretend to be your relatives,

04:12:46.680 --> 04:12:49.240
在你食物里下药 拍摄你
and they put drugs in your food and they film you

04:12:49.840 --> 04:12:51.520
每个游戏里都有讯息
There's messages in every game.

04:12:51.920 --> 04:12:54.240
比如吃豆人 你知道游戏名PAC代表什么吗？
Like Pac-Man, do you know what PAC stands for?

04:12:55.280 --> 04:12:57.480
PAC即“规划与控制”
P-A-C. Program and Control.

04:12:57.760 --> 04:12:59.400
吃豆人其实就是规划与控制者
He's Program and Control Man.

04:13:00.560 --> 04:13:01.400
整个游戏都是一种隐喻
The whole thing's a metaphor.

04:13:01.840 --> 04:13:04.520
他以为自己有自由意志 但其实是困在迷宫里
He thinks he's got free will but really, he's trapped in a maze,

04:13:04.880 --> 04:13:06.840
困在体系里 只能吃吃吃
in a system, all he can do is consume,

04:13:06.920 --> 04:13:09.080
追逐他的恶魔 大概是他假想出来的
he's pursued by demons that are probably just in his own head.

04:13:09.600 --> 04:13:12.160
就算他从迷宫一侧逃离出来了
And even if he does manage to escape by slipping out one side of the maze,

04:13:12.560 --> 04:13:14.600
又会发生什么？ 他马上又从另一侧回到了迷宫里
what happens? He comes right back in the other side.

04:13:15.320 --> 04:13:16.480
大家以为这是个开心的游戏
People think it's a happy game,

04:13:16.840 --> 04:13:19.640
但并非如此 那是个噩梦世界
it's not a happy game, it's a fucking nightmare world

04:13:19.720 --> 04:13:22.000
最糟糕的是 那世界是真实的 我们都活在其中
and the worst thing is it's real and we live in it.

04:13:22.520 --> 04:13:23.720
全是代码
It's all a code.

04:13:24.040 --> 04:13:26.040
仔细听的话 能听到数字
If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers.

04:13:27.800 --> 04:13:30.280
宇宙有一张流程图 决定了你可以去哪
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can

04:13:30.880 --> 04:13:32.560
不可以去哪
and where you can't go.

04:13:33.840 --> 04:13:36.640
我已经给了你这份知识 让你自由了
I've given you the knowledge. I've set you free.

04:13:39.080 --> 04:13:40.040
你明白吗？
Do you understand?

04:13:42.440 --> 04:13:43.440
也许吧
Maybe.

04:13:45.480 --> 04:13:46.440
嗯 算是吧
Yes. Sort of.

04:13:46.920 --> 04:13:48.320
我让你看看我是什么意思
I'll show you what I mean.

04:13:49.960 --> 04:13:51.080
跟我来
Come with me.

04:13:59.400 --> 04:14:00.960
我们在一条路线上
We're on one path.

04:14:01.680 --> 04:14:03.160
现在的我和你
Right now, me and you.

04:14:04.200 --> 04:14:06.640
一条路线如何终结并不重要
And how one path ends is immaterial.

04:14:07.000 --> 04:14:12.560
重要的是我们在这条路线上的决定 对整体造成的影响
It's how our decisions along that path affect the whole that matters.

04:14:13.360 --> 04:14:14.600
你相信我吗？
Do you believe me?

2686
04:14:15.640 --> 04:14:19.760
- I don't know. - I'll prove it.

04:14:17.240 --> 04:14:19.760
-不知道 -我证明给你看

04:14:20.760 --> 04:14:24.000
我们中的一个人过去
One of us is going over.

04:14:25.440 --> 04:14:26.320
过去那边
Over there.

04:14:30.800 --> 04:14:31.800
你会死的
You'd die. You'd die.

04:14:32.680 --> 04:14:34.080
不重要
It wouldn't matter because there are other timelines, Stefan.

04:14:34.520 --> 04:14:36.680
因为还有其他时间线 斯蒂芬

04:14:37.520 --> 04:14:39.840
你看到吃豆人死过多少次了？
How many times have you watched Pac-Man die?

04:14:40.520 --> 04:14:41.800
对他没什么影响
Doesn't bother him.

04:14:43.080 --> 04:14:44.400
他重新来过就好
He just tries again.

04:14:45.440 --> 04:14:46.680
我们俩之间的一个人要跳
One of us is jumping.

04:14:47.720 --> 04:14:49.080
是谁？
So, who's it going to be?

04:14:54.680 --> 04:14:56.400
上面凉风习习
There's a nice breeze up here.

04:14:59.720 --> 04:15:00.720
来吧
So come on.

04:15:02.160 --> 04:15:03.560
我们俩谁跳？
Which one of us is jumping?

04:15:09.480 --> 04:15:11.360
（微游戏）

04:15:11.440 --> 04:15:14.560
所以 今日的线框模型
So, that's how the wireframe models of today

04:15:14.640 --> 04:15:17.760
可能会成为好莱坞未来的娱乐
might provide the Hollywood entertainment of the future.

04:15:18.040 --> 04:15:19.040
克里斯宾
- Crispin. - Thanks, Leslie.

04:15:19.160 --> 04:15:20.320
谢谢 莱斯莉

04:15:20.960 --> 04:15:24.800
昨日 在数周的争议和猜测之后
Now, yesterday, following weeks of controversy and speculation,

04:15:24.880 --> 04:15:29.000
塔克软件游戏公司宣布被行政接管
games company Tuckersoft announced it's going into administration.

04:15:29.080 --> 04:15:30.200
哪里出问题了呢？
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

04:15:30.960 --> 04:15:34.000
仅仅六个月前 塔克软件还势头汹汹
<i>Just six months ago,</i> <i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

04:15:34.080 --> 04:15:36.400
一系列热门产品占据榜首
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

04:15:36.480 --> 04:15:40.480
大家对其圣诞大作《潘达斯奈基》的 期待也不断走高
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i> <i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

04:15:40.960 --> 04:15:43.000
但《潘达斯奈基》流产了
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

04:15:43.080 --> 04:15:46.560
因为游戏创作者 19岁的斯蒂芬·巴特勒被逮捕
following the arrest and subsequent murder charge against its creator,

04:15:46.760 --> 04:15:49.160
并面临谋杀指控
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

04:15:49.240 --> 04:15:51.560
指控罪名是在心理崩溃后
<i>who stands accused</i> <i>of murdering his father</i>

04:15:51.640 --> 04:15:53.520
谋杀了亲生父亲
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:56.200
这使大家质疑
<i>This has raised questions</i> <i>about the judgment</i>

04:15:56.280 --> 04:15:59.000
塔克软件老板莫汗·塔克尔的判断力
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

04:15:59.480 --> 04:16:02.320
是他想一个人做 是他的决定
It was his idea to do it alone. His decision.

04:16:02.480 --> 04:16:04.320
我也不知道他干不来
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

04:16:04.640 --> 04:16:06.400
我知道他父亲死了
I mean, I know his dad's dead, rest his soul,

04:16:07.000 --> 04:16:08.240
愿他安息

04:16:08.520 --> 04:16:10.240
但我也是受害者
but I'm a victim, too. Let's try to not forget that.

04:16:10.320 --> 04:16:12.160
不要忘记这一点

04:16:12.480 --> 04:16:16.640
塔克软件另一位门生 著名程序师科林·里特曼
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i> <i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

04:16:16.720 --> 04:16:21.240
认为可以从巴特勒失控事件中 学到重要的教训
<i>believes there are important lessons</i> <i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

04:16:21.560 --> 04:16:24.160
如果斯蒂芬能听到你说话 你会对他说什么？
What would you say to Stefan, if he could hear you?

04:16:25.360 --> 04:16:26.920
我会说 再试一次
I'd say try again.

04:16:27.880 --> 04:16:28.840
但他在监狱里
But he's in prison.

04:16:30.000 --> 04:16:31.680
只是在这条人生而已
<i>Only in this life.</i>

04:16:32.240 --> 04:16:34.920
采访不久后 科林·里特曼
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i> <i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

04:16:35.000 --> 04:16:37.240
因持有管制物品而被逮捕
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

04:16:37.320 --> 04:16:39.800
塔克公司永远关上了大门
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i> <i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

04:16:40.080 --> 04:16:42.880
《潘达斯奈基》无处可寻

04:16:58.440 --> 04:17:01.120
够娱乐了吗 心理变态？
How's that for entertainment, you psychiatric fuck?

04:17:02.160 --> 04:17:04.200
让你一天都很不爽吧 是不是？
Fucked your day up good and proper, didn't we?

04:17:04.280 --> 04:17:07.000
我和来自未来的朋友！
Me and my friend from the future!

04:17:15.120 --> 04:17:16.040
考虑到这一点
With that in mind, I think it's important you stay on the pharmaceutical path

04:17:16.640 --> 04:17:18.760
我觉得你最好还是继续用药

04:17:18.840 --> 04:17:20.200
至少在未来几个月
at least for the next few months.

04:17:20.760 --> 04:17:23.120
我稍微提高剂量
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

04:17:25.800 --> 04:17:26.880
斯蒂芬
Stefan.

04:17:27.680 --> 04:17:28.920
不要把这视为挫折
Don't see this as a setback.

04:17:30.000 --> 04:17:32.120
你并不孤单 我们一起面对
You're not alone. We're in it together.

04:17:33.480 --> 04:17:36.640
我为人人 人人…
One for all, and all...

04:17:38.800 --> 04:17:39.840
为我
For one.

04:17:44.080 --> 04:17:46.880
有情况就给我打电话
If anything happens, just call me.

04:17:47.320 --> 04:17:48.640
你知道号码
You know the number.

04:17:50.000 --> 04:17:52.000
（房间3 海恩斯医生）

04:17:55.120 --> 04:17:56.040
怎么样？
How was it?

04:17:57.560 --> 04:17:58.560
还好
It was fine.

2743
04:18:00.040 --> 04:18:02.120
Breathe. In, out.

04:18:01.160 --> 04:18:02.120
吸气 呼气

04:18:03.000 --> 04:18:04.280
呼吸
Breathe.

04:18:04.760 --> 04:18:05.760
呼吸

04:18:19.280 --> 04:18:21.600
-不好 -不好？
- No. - No?

04:18:23.360 --> 04:18:24.440
那小子给我胡闹
The boy's a clown.

04:18:24.920 --> 04:18:26.280
混账东西
Well, tough tit-holes.

04:18:26.360 --> 04:18:28.600
你签了合同 别给我犯傻
You signed a contract, so don't be a pillock.

04:18:28.680 --> 04:18:29.600
想让我去收拾你吗？
<i>Do you want me go down there?</i>

04:18:29.880 --> 04:18:31.000
给我抓紧点
Pull your finger out. I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

04:18:31.080 --> 04:18:33.960
今天结束前交工 再见！

04:18:37.760 --> 04:18:41.440
-永远不要催一个艺术家 -别说废话
- Never rush an artist. - Oh, blow it out your bumhole.

04:18:41.640 --> 04:18:44.720
他需要探索所有可能 所有现实
He needs to explore all possibilities. All realities.

04:18:45.160 --> 04:18:47.640
脚别搭在我桌上 这个现实如何？
How about a reality where you get your feet off my table?

04:18:49.200 --> 04:18:51.960
敢对我说“不” 我要给他点颜色看看
Fucking "no." I'll show him fucking "no."

04:19:05.320 --> 04:19:06.600
我们会成为热门产品工厂
We're going to be a hit factory. Like Motown, but for computer games.

04:19:06.880 --> 04:19:09.080
就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片

04:19:09.160 --> 04:19:10.040
这话 你是第一个听到的人
- You heard it here first. - Colin Ritman.

我们之前见过
We've met before.

04:19:13.360 --> 04:19:14.600
-你怎么想？ -不
- What's your answer? - No.

04:19:14.760 --> 04:19:16.680
-很厉害 -和海恩斯医生谈谈
Well done, mate. Speak to Dr. Haynes about it, and listen to her.

04:19:16.920 --> 04:19:17.760
听听她的话

04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:19.760
做得好 斯蒂芬
- Well done, Stefan. - You sound like my dad.

04:19:20.080 --> 04:19:20.960
你和我爸说的话一样

04:19:21.600 --> 04:19:22.440
哦
Oh.

04:19:23.160 --> 04:19:27.760
你想谈谈你母亲的遭遇吗？
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

04:19:34.160 --> 04:19:36.800
回顾往事可能会有帮助
It can be helpful to revisit things.

04:19:36.880 --> 04:19:39.240
哪怕你觉得之前已经这样做过
Even if you feel like you've done this before.

04:19:40.920 --> 04:19:44.240
你可能会有新的发现
You might discover something new.

04:19:48.440 --> 04:19:49.840
-潘达什么？ -潘达斯奈基
- Your Bander-what? - Bandersnatch.

04:19:50.080 --> 04:19:51.280
是你母亲的书吧？
Is that your mother's?

04:19:51.760 --> 04:19:53.800
就像电脑游戏界的摩城唱片
Like Motown, but for computer games.

04:20:00.600 --> 04:20:02.040
-太过？ -太过理想 不像是真的
- Too? - Good to be true.

04:20:02.320 --> 04:20:04.200
-你来还是不来？ -不去！
- Are you coming or not? - No!

04:20:04.400 --> 04:20:06.240
因为我 她只能坐晚一点的火车
Because of me she had to catch a later train.

你坐着一言不发 我也帮不了你
Look, I can't help if you just sit there and don't speak!
